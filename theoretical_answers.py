    # Q1: TensorFlow vs PyTorch Differences
    print("\n1. TENSORFLOW VS PYTORCH COMPARISON")
    print("-" * 40)

    print("""
PRIMARY DIFFERENCES:

TensorFlow (by Google):
• Static computation graph - defines entire graph before execution
• Production-focused with TensorFlow Serving, TFX for deployment
• Excellent for mobile/embedded deployment (TensorFlow Lite)
• Strong visualization tools (TensorBoard)
• Larger community and more production deployments

PyTorch (by Facebook/Meta):
• Dynamic computation graph - builds graph on-the-fly
• More Pythonic and intuitive syntax
• Easier debugging with standard Python debugging tools
• Better for research and experimentation
• Native Python control flow in model definitions

TARGET: WHEN TO CHOOSE EACH:

Choose TensorFlow when:
• Building production ML systems requiring deployment
• Working with mobile/edge devices
• Need strong visualization and monitoring tools
• Team familiarity with static graph frameworks
• Enterprise deployment with existing TensorFlow infrastructure

Choose PyTorch when:
• Research and rapid prototyping
• Need flexibility in model architecture
• Easier debugging and development experience
• Academic projects or experimental work
• Dynamic models with varying input sizes

    # Q2: Jupyter Notebooks Use Cases

    print("-" * 50)

    print("""
BOOKS: TWO KEY USE CASES:

1. EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) & RAPID PROTOTYPING:
• Interactive data exploration with immediate visual feedback
• Quick iteration on data preprocessing and feature engineering
• Testing different algorithms and hyperparameters rapidly
• Sharing insights with stakeholders through rich, executable documents
• Perfect for experimental ML workflow before production implementation

Example: In our Iris classification task, Jupyter allows interactive exploration
of feature distributions, correlation analysis, and model comparison before
final implementation.

2. EDUCATIONAL CONTENT & REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH:
• Creating interactive tutorials and educational materials
• Documenting research methodology with executable code
• Sharing reproducible experiments with the scientific community
• Collaborative development with real-time code sharing
• Version control integration for research transparency

Example: AI researchers use Jupyter to document experiments, share findings,
and enable others to reproduce results with the same data and code.

    # Q3: spaCy vs Basic Python String Operations
    print("\n3. SPACY ENHANCEMENT OVER BASIC PYTHON STRING OPERATIONS")
    print("-" * 60)

    print("""
ROCKET: SPACY'S ADVANTAGES FOR NLP TASKS:

BASIC PYTHON STRING LIMITATIONS:
• Manual tokenization prone to errors (e.g., "don't" --> ["don", "'t"])
• No linguistic understanding (treats "run" as same in all contexts)
• No part-of-speech tagging or dependency parsing
• Limited multilingual support
• No pre-trained models for common NLP tasks

SPACY ENHANCEMENTS:

1. INTELLIGENT TOKENIZATION:
• Handles contractions, punctuation, and special cases properly
• Language-specific rules for different writing systems
• Multi-language support with consistent API

2. LINGUISTIC ANNOTATIONS:
• Part-of-speech tagging for grammatical analysis
• Dependency parsing for sentence structure understanding
• Named Entity Recognition (NER) for extracting entities
• Lemmatization for word normalization

3. PRE-TRAINED MODELS:
• State-of-the-art accuracy on common NLP tasks
• Transfer learning capabilities
• Domain-specific models available
• Consistent performance across tasks

4. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
• Written in Cython for speed
• Memory efficient processing
• Batch processing capabilities
• Production-ready performance

Example from our implementation:
- Basic Python: "iPhone 14 Pro" --> ["iPhone", "14", "Pro"] (incorrect split)
- spaCy: "iPhone 14 Pro" --> recognizes as single PRODUCT entity with proper context
