## Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

### 1. TensorFlow vs PyTorch Comparison

#### Primary Differences:

**TensorFlow (by Google):**
- Static computation graph - defines entire graph before execution
- Production-focused with TensorFlow Serving, TFX for deployment
- Excellent for mobile/embedded deployment (TensorFlow Lite)
- Strong visualization tools (TensorBoard)
- Larger community and more production deployments

**PyTorch (by Facebook/Meta):**
- Dynamic computation graph - builds graph on-the-fly
- More Pythonic and intuitive syntax
- Easier debugging with standard Python debugging tools
- Better for research and experimentation
- Native Python control flow in model definitions

#### When to Choose Each:

**Choose TensorFlow when:**
- Building production ML systems requiring deployment
- Working with mobile/edge devices

- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for extracting entities
- Lemmatization for word normalization

**3. PRE-TRAINED MODELS:**
- State-of-the-art accuracy on common NLP tasks
- Transfer learning capabilities
- Domain-specific models available
- Consistent performance across tasks

**4. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:**

- Memory efficient processing
- Batch processing capabilities
- Production-ready performance

### 4. Comparative Analysis: Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow

#### Target Applications:

**Scikit-learn:**
- Classical machine learning algorithms

## Part 3: Ethics & Optimization

### Ethical Considerations in AI Development

#### Potential Biases Identified:

**MNIST Model Bias Analysis:**
- Cultural Bias: Handwriting styles vary across cultures

- Demographic Bias: Reviews from specific age/income groups
- Temporal Bias: Changing language and sentiment patterns over time

#### Bias Mitigation Strategies:

**Data Diversification:**
- Collect training data from diverse geographic regions
- Include various age groups and educational backgrounds
- Incorporate multiple languages and cultural contexts

**Algorithmic Fairness:**
- Implement fairness constraints during training
- Use adversarial debiasing techniques
- Regular bias auditing with tools like Fairness Indicators

**Evaluation Metrics:**
